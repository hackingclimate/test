      <header>Paris is Not Enough - Part I</header>
      Over the last 9 months, I've spent a great deal of time teaching myself climate science from first principles. <a href="https://hackingclimate.github.io/paris/part1.html" target="_blank">Here's what I've learnt.</a>

    <section class="about-me">
      <header>About me</header>
      My name is Sacha Saint-Leger. <a href="http://twitter.com/hackingclimate" target="_blank">@hackingclimate</a>
      <p>Right now I'm committed to learning as much as I can about how blockchain computers can help us preserve nature and accelerate the energy transition. I'll be distilling what I learn, and communicating it through <a href="https://pudding.cool/about/" target="_blank">visual essays</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_design" target="_blank">interactive designs.</a></p>
      <p>Last year I spent some time coding, designing, writing, and researching the future of energy at <a href="https://bestiario.org" target="_blank">bestiario_</a></p>
      <p>Before that I spent a year obsessed with designing and printing mathematical patterns onto espadrilles I would make by hand. </p>
      <p>And before that I was mainly studying economics, maths and computer science at McGill university. My philosophy was to take the courses I was most interested in, regardless of whether they were necessary or useful. This led me to accidentally graduating with a computer science degree.</p>
